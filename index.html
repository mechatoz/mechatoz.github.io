                <h4>From Convolutional Operator Learning to Neural Network in Global Approach: Acceleration, Convergence, and Application</h4>
                <p class="text-left">
		   "Learning" convolutional operators from large datasets and applying the learned operators is a growing trend in a wide range of applications in signal/image processing and computer vision. 
		   Patch-based approach&mdash;referred to the <i>local</i> approach&mdash;is a well-known kernel learning framework for offering straightforward mathematical formulation and optimization. 
		   However, this approach is not well-suited to learning kernels from "big data" and/or applying the learned operators to solve large-dimensional inverse problems, because it needs to store many overlapping patches extracted from the training or testing images.
		   This becomes even more problematic in forming (deep) hierarchical representations, e.g., <i>(de)convolutional neural network</i> ((de)CNN).
		   The recent <i>global</i> approach resolves the issues by learning kernels and obtaining (sparse) representations directly in the image domain without storing many overlapping patches.
                   I am the first researcher in developing fast and convergence-guaranteed convolutional operator learning frameworks within the global approach, e.g., <i>convolutional dictionary learning</i> and <i>convolutional analysis operator learning</i> (CAOL), via the so-called <i>Block Proximal Gradient method using Majorizer</i> (BPG-M) that sheds new light on tight majorization in solving block multi-(non)convex problems.
		   The learned convolutional operators improved image recovery performance for some extreme imaging applications, e.g., sparse-view CT and denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images. 
		</p>
		<p class="text-left">	
		   From 2015, researchers have been studying algorithmic properties of training (deep) CNNs by reformulating their objective function.
		   More recently, there have been some attempts to moderate some problems of stochastic gradient methods in which gradients are computed by back-propagation&mdash;the most widely used optimization technique in training CNN.
		   However, there exist no solid frameworks based on accelerated proximal gradient method to maximally accelerate the training convergence of CNN.
		   On the application sides, researchers have begun to apply (deep) NNs to iterative signal/image recovery models. 
		   However, they lack "complete" mathematical models in iterative signal recovery; it limits comprehensively understand/analyze them in terms of both signal recovery and algorithmic properties, e.g., acceleration and convergence.
		   I am a pioneer in mathematically formulating CNNs (e.g., LeNet-5) particularly suitable for iterative signal/image recovery, while overcoming the aforementioned limitations via the CAOL and BPG-M frameworks.

                <h4>Compressed Sensing and Parallel Acquisition: Theory and Application</h4>
                <p class="text-left">
		   <i>Parallel acquisition</i> systems are employed successfully in a variety of different sensing/imaging applications (e.g., parallel MRI, multi-view imaging, wireless sensor networks, light-field imaging with muptiple focal stacks, synthetic aperture radar imaging, derivative sampling in seismic imaging, etc.) when a single sensor cannot provide enough measurements for a high-quality signal recovery.  
	           Compressed sensing (CS), random sub-sampling theory dependent on the sparsity of signal, has been used to establish the theoretical improvements of such systems by providing recovery guarantees for which, subject to appropriate conditions, the number of measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of sensors.
		   I am a pioneer in establishing theoretical improvements of CS parallel acquisition architecture, developing CS-based imaging fundamentals, and applying these theories in practical applications, e.g., parallel MRI (MRI using multiple receive coils) and light-field imaging with multiple focal stacks.

                <h4>Adaptive Computational Imaging: Theory and Application</h4>
                <p class="text-left">		
                    Most imaging devices have complicated imaging physics and suffer from various types of noise. This is the main reason that underlying mathematical analyses are largely absent in their image recovery performance. If undersampling schemes are involved, the performance analysis becomes a tricky math problem. 
		    By exploiting signal processing estimation techniques (e.g., mean square error, MSE, and SNR) and stochastic modeling, my third research interest is to adaptively control imaging techniques to improve the quality of reconstructed images. 
		    For example, I initially established the imaging fundamentals of (high-field) MRI using multiple transmit/receive coils and its relation to MSE, and proposed a new excitation pattern design which further reduces MSE and manages the specific absorption rate.
		    In particular, adaptively considering the spatial information of transmit and receive coils and expected aliasing patterns, the proposed excitation pattern not only successfully reduces the error variances but also suppresses the aliasing artifacts caused by extremely accelerating (i.e., 8-fold) scanning.

                <h4>Translational Imaging: Neuroimaging and Neuroscience</h4>
                <p class="text-left">
		    Recently, rapid interest has grown in the neuroscience community in evaluating the impact of brain changes caused by repetitive sub-concussive hits to the head.	
		    Using diffusion tensor MRI, I evaluated longitudinal white matter changes in high-school football players and examined how these changes may be linked to an athlete’s history of accumulated head collision events during practices and games.
		</p>
                <p class="text-left">
		    On the other hand, an appropriate statistical image analysis framework (e.g., hypothesis testing) to reliably detect subtle changes in athletes who experienced repetitive sub-concussive head blows is largely absent. 
		    I initially proposed a stronger randomized hypothesis testing method that exploits both completely and incompletely paired data. 
		    The method successfully detects more significantly deviated regions in the sub-concussed brains, thereby providing a stronger evidence to suggest that head impacts commonly occur during contact sports have the potential for neurological injury although those impacts do not result in visible symptoms of neurological dysfunction.
                </p>

		Current technologies in automatic medical image analysis, e.g., registration, segmentation, and classification, are imperfect in their accuracy.  A combination of multiple information from intensity and gradient would be useful to improve the performance, e.g., in multi-modal image registration.
		In neuroscience society, an appropriate statistical image analysis framework is largely absent, e.g., for hypothesis testing.  A combination of complete and incomplete paired data results in larger pool size; it is expected to increase detection power.  The stronger hypothesis testing method is particularly useful to reliably detect subtle changes in athletes who experienced subconcussive head blows.
